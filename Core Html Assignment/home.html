  <p>Hi! This is <b>Vidushi Singh's</b> blog here. I am a student, who has just taken admission in Btech-CSE. This course, by PW is a skill development source for me. I am a person with great passion towards always learning new skills that helps me grow and so here I am trying something different. Apart from this, I was a scholar in my school as well and scored pretty decent in both my board classes. Now, stating about my personal life- I originally belong to Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh but currently I am living in Delhi for my education.</p>
